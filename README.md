# Egoist Issue Tracker
## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create an issue tracker system. This system will include a website that allows users to submit issues, allow community managers to aggregate issues and categorize them into issue reports, allow development team leads to assign priorities to the issue reports and also assign teams to issues, lastly this system will allow teams to track progress on the issue reports.
### Subgoals
#### Website
The website will allow anyone to submit an issue to the system. This issue will be logged into a database that is a collection of all submissions that can be viewed by any Community Managers. The Community Managers then will group all the similar reports into an issue report. These issue reports will be able to be viewed on the website. A user will be able to see the issue, date reported, and status.
#### Company Issue Manager Application
This is a C# application that will allow an employee to log in and view relevant information. If they are a community manager they will see the issueâ€™s table. They will be able to view an issue and assign it to an issue report. This report should have a collection of issues and a summary of it as well as all the log files submitted with the issues. The development leads will be able to see all issue reports. Then the lead developers will give issue reports a priority and a team. The lead developer of the team will assign the tasks to team members. Each developer will be able to see all the issues that their team has and all tasks assigned to them. When an issue is assigned to a team each member will get an email and if they opt-in to it they will receive a text as well.
#### Database
The database will be build using PostgreSQL
